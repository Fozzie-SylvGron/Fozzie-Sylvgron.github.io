        Worked as lead developer on this rework of the previous SocialSkills App, Solving a lot of technical depth by pretty much remaking most of it.<br>
        
        <br>This was a major rework on almost everything in the app (excluding game scenarios), I remade the Puzzle, Coloring and Drawing Mini Game, 
        worked on an unlock system. Set up most of the ui in the app(excluding Books and Emotion game(Mirror)).
        <br>One of the big changes was to not need internet while playing since most of our users are chldren.
