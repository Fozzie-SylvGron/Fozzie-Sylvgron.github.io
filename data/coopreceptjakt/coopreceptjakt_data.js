        <br>Augmented reality app prototype made for Coop, for finding your way to ingredients with AR characters leading you there.
       
        <br>Worked with UnityÂ´s AR fundation to place character (and move it) in a Agumented Reality Environment based on a physical store(s).
        I Did all the major application parts with UI code and interaction. 

        What i did (programming):<br>
        <br>- UI.
        <br>- AR Fundation implemetation.
        <br>- Core App Systems.
        <br>- OnBoarding System.
        <br>- Letter Drawing Mini Game (so the user still have something to do if they choose not to/cant use ar).
        <br>- "Simpler" iOS and Android specific code for asking permissions.
        <br>- Pathfinding(unitys).
        <br>- Store ingredient location system.
        <br>- Editor Tool for settings Store ingredient locations.
